Activities and games such as motivational songs ,Hangman,Hot seat, Board Race, Interview ect. were  recommended and encouraged to be played in class. Each student bloomed in my English class and I could smell the fragrance of English in my classroom. It's a very good initiative and I really feel proud to be a part of this programme. Thank you",
